1	“Abigail Spanberger still votes with and shares Joe Biden’s positions 100% of the time.”	mostly-true	Republican candidate Yesli Vega claims that incumbent Democrat Rep. Abigail Spanberger votes with and shares President Joe Biden's positions 100% of the time. To support this claim, Vega cites specific votes that Spanberger has made in alignment with Biden's agenda. Spanberger has voted to expand firearm regulations, cap out-of-pocket insulin costs, strengthen voting rights laws, expand debt limits, protect abortion rights, invest $1.2 trillion in infrastructure, and provide $1.9 trillion for COVID-19 relief. However, Spanberger has also shown some disagreement with certain aspects of Biden's policies, such as those related to the U.S.-Mexico border.	NW	0	0	0	0	0
2	"“The Walker-Kleefisch administration slashed $800 million from public schools."""	barely-true	The state Democratic Party of Wisconsin continues to claim that the Walker-Kleefisch administration slashed $800 million from public schools. However, similar claims have been debunked in the past. While the administration did cut close to that amount in a single two-year budget, it overlooks the money saved through Act 10 and subsequent funding increases that have restored a large portion of the reduction. Media reports provided by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin acknowledge both sides of the equation, but the claim remains largely unchanged.	NW	0	1	0	1	0

4	“Gas prices have been going up since the president’s first day in office, starting with his move to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline.”	half-true	Gas prices and crude oil prices have been on an upward trajectory throughout President Biden's tenure. There is no evidence that Biden's action on the Keystone XL pipeline caused an increase in gas prices. Gas prices were already rising due to increased demand following the easing of pandemic restrictions. The most recent spike in gas prices is largely due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Despite U.S. Senator Joni Ernst's claim, gas prices did not simply turn upward after Biden took office or canceled the Keystone XL pipeline.	NW	0	0	0	0	0

However, there are no credible reports from the Buffalo News or any other news organization to support this.

Build Back Better would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years, with funding for social safety-net programs and climate change initiatives. Experts agree that the bill would be a significant expansion of social welfare programs.

9	Images show how climate change destroyed the Greenland ice sheet and harmed a polar bear from 2009 to 2019.	FALSE	Jennifer Francis from the Woodell Climate Research Center points to studies indicating that polar bears' health is decreasing due to rapid sea ice loss. Polar bears require sea ice to capture sea lions. However, Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, explains that there is no direct connection between the ice loss in Greenland and the condition of the distressed polar bear. The Greenland ice sheet's changes and polar bears' health are two separate issues caused by different factors.	NW	0	0	0	0	0

Inflation has been increasing every month since Biden took office, except for a slight plateau in mid-2021.

Iceland continues to administer Moderna for booster shots for those 60 and older. Among the listed countries, only Sweden temporarily suspended the use of Moderna for all people under 30. Finland limits Moderna to men and boys under 30. Norway recommends Pfizer over Moderna for certain individuals but does not prohibit anyone from taking Moderna.

Shipley clarifies that teachers who teach ideas like inherent racism or tenets of Critical Race Theory should not receive pay raises.

16	“Jen Kiggans’ campaign confirmed today that she would support a national abortion ban.”	half-true	U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, R-Virginia, claims Rep. Jen Kiggans supports a national abortion ban, referring to a bill introduced by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham that would ban abortion after 15 weeks. However, Kiggans has not explicitly endorsed the bill and her stance on abortion is unclear. Luria's claim is based on a vague statement made by a spokesman for Kiggans' campaign. The bill is unlikely to pass and President Biden is likely to veto it if it does. Kiggans' position on the bill remains unclear.	NW	0	0	0	0	0

18	Every time a Republican has been elected president over the last few decades, House Democrats have objected to the result	mostly-true	Derek T. Muller, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law, documented the history of Democrats objecting to Republican presidential winners. House Democrats made objections in 2001, 2005, and 2017, but the objections were considered symbolic as the losing candidates had already conceded. In 2001, black voters in Florida being disenfranchised was a concern, but the objections were ultimately gaveled down by Vice President Al Gore. The objections made in prior years were regarded as disconcerting, even if they lacked the same intent to overturn the election results as the 2021 objections.	NW	1	1	1	1	0

20	About a federal hospital price transparency requirement, “Nobody’s enforcing that law.”	half-true	Although hospitals have been slow to post the required price information, enforcement efforts are gradually ramping up. The transparency directive is a first-of-its-kind rule, leading to a learning curve for hospitals and regulators. However, experts point out that the availability of price data alone may not lead to a consumer revolution in healthcare, as patients often rely on recommendations from their doctors and may find it challenging to navigate the complex data.

Zach Nunn put his big donor first, ahead of the safety of Iowa families.”	barely-true	An attack ad in Iowa's 3rd Congressional District campaign criticizes Zach Nunn, the Republican nominee, accusing him of prioritizing a big donor over the safety of Iowa families. The ad claims that Nunn sponsored legislation, House File 558, which loosened amusement park safety rules. However, Nunn's campaign disputes this, stating that the legislation aimed to improve workforce opportunities and minimize unemployment in Iowa. Additionally, the ad suggests that Gov. Kim Reynolds signed the bill into law, and Nunn's response refutes the ad's claims. Paige Godden, a representative from Cindy Axne's campaign, defends the ad's messaging.	NW	0	0	0	0	0

25	"The Biden administration ""published a study concluding 4 (of) 5 new cars on the road by 2050 will still require liquid fuels."""	TRUE	Iowa, the leading state in biofuel production from farm crops, has a capacity to produce 4.6 billion gallons of biofuels, double that of the second-ranking state, Nebraska. The biofuels industry in Iowa, supported by congressional members from both parties, urges President Joe Biden to fulfill his promise of expanding support for biofuels. This call for support stems from the fact that 79% of vehicles on the road in the United States are projected to require liquid fuels, and biofuels are an essential component of that category.

The state's new elections law, requiring ID information on mail ballot applications, has caused confusion and rejections. The office reports that as of December 20, around 100,000 registered Texas voters do not have identification numbers on their voter registration records.

Task Force Argo has collaborated with other groups like #AfghanEvac and has been commended for their efforts in assisting Afghans and providing much-needed support.

Mike Lee in Utah's U.S. Senate race. The race in heavily Republican Utah could play a role in determining Senate control, which is currently split 50-50.

These ads made exaggerated claims about the availability of abortions throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy in certain states. While the laws in Alaska, Colorado, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont do not explicitly prohibit abortions at any stage of pregnancy, abortions later in pregnancy are rare and usually only performed for urgent medical reasons.

36	"""Ron Johnson has voted against funding for law enforcement and recently opposed a plan to recruit and train new officers """	FALSE	Barnes accuses Johnson of voting against funding for law enforcement and opposing a plan to recruit and train new officers. However, the evidence for both claims is weak. Johnson's vote against the American Rescue Plan Act does not equate to voting against law enforcement funding. The relief package provided flexibility for state and local governments to use funds for essential workers, including law enforcement, but it did not guarantee direct support. It is crucial to distinguish between one-time cash injections and existing funding. Additionally, Johnson has backed measures and received endorsements from police groups, indicating Democratic support for law enforcement.	U	0	0	0	0	0

This does not include programs announced in this year. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' team argues that having nearly $750 million of funds expended or obligated within a year's time, with five years available to spend the funds, meets the definition of 'acting quickly.'

The increase in homicides in the US in 2020, and potentially 2021, is attributed to isolation, economic distress caused by COVID-19, and conflicts arising from social media use.

However, Barnes advocates reducing the prison population gradually. The National Republican Senatorial Committee accuses Barnes based on his involvement with the 11x15 campaign.

Winsome Earle-Sears claimed that Loudoun County School Board spent about $300,000 last year to bring critical race theory to the school system. However, records show that the money was spent between September 2018 and June 2020, primarily on equity efforts. While the school system did pay $34,167 for seminars on critical race theory, critics argue that the majority of the spending was focused on improving racial equity and fairness in schools, not on teaching CRT to students.

It can be the same person attempting to cross multiple times. U.S. Customs and Border Protection explained that total encounters somewhat overstate the number of unique individuals arriving at the border due to the large number of expulsions during the pandemic.

FALSE	A simulation video on Facebook claims to show the 'Ghost of Kyiv' (a Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter pilot) shooting down a Russian plane. However, the video is from a video game called Digital Combat Simulator. It is unclear whether the pilot actually exists. Reports suggest that the Ghost of Kyiv downed six Russian planes on the first day of the invasion, although experts doubt this. The Ukrainian Armed Forces reported shooting down five Russian aircraft and a helicopter, but the Russian military denied these reports.

Kincaid argues that the post falsely suggests that organized labor efforts have made no progress, ignoring the gains made by workers. He explains that the average worker during the Victorian era worked long hours and that there is no straightforward way to convert Cratchit's wages to today's U.S. wages. Kincaid emphasizes that Dickens and his readers had a clear understanding of what constituted a barely-above-starvation wage for a worker like Cratchit and his family.	NW	0	0	0	0	0

Biden ended the policy soon after taking office. The administration was ordered to reinstate these protocols by a federal court in Texas in August, and the Supreme Court upheld that decision. Customs and Border Protection reported a total of 1.7 million encounters with migrants at the southwestern border in the last fiscal year, with over 1 million individuals encountered year-to-date in fiscal 2021.

In the Crump case, Beasley's vote was based on a fair trial violation relating to racial bias in jury selection.

The bill provides narrow exceptions for gym class and special education classrooms, and it envisions the livestream taking place over a secure platform like Zoom.

These individuals, who were involved in the submission of uncertified Trump electors, were not ordinary citizens but members of the Republican National Committee. The investigation into their actions is part of finding the facts surrounding the broader scheme to overturn the 2020 election.
